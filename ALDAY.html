There is no specific medication for stress. But there are medications that can help reduce or manage some of the signs and symptoms of stress.
For example, your doctor might offer to prescribe:
Sleeping pills or minor tranquillisers, if you're having trouble sleeping.
Antidepressants, if you're experiencing depression or anxiety alongside stress.
Medication to treat any physical symptoms of stress, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or high blood pressure</p></center>

          <center><p>Sense of smell is one of the fastest senses that can trigger one's consciousness in a particular situation.When trying to create a restful environment, you should always consider adding a relaxing scent. Aromatherapy is a long standing relaxation tool, which can help to ease stress and anxiety and can help to create your perfect restful and calming space.One of these is a well known aromatherapy scent – lavender. Lavender is well known for aiding relaxation and rest, however, less well known is that lavender has also been proven in a 2012 study to lower blood pressure, heart rate and skin temperature. These are all signs of your body physically relaxing in response to the smell of the lavender.
Whilst you may already know the calming effects of chamomile when drunk as a tea, chamomile is equally effective when used as an essential oil in aromatherapy. Studies have found chamomile to have a range of beneficial effects, and one of these is to aid relaxation and reduction in anxiety. One study found that stress hormones decreased after inhaling chamomile extract.

          <center><p>A tai chi practice involves slow-motion flow — and with that comes a cadre of health benefits, too, including better balance, mobility, and coordination. Tai chi (also called tai chi chuan or tai ji quan) is a mind-body exercise that combines movements, meditation, and deep breathing, according to the American Tai Chi and Qigong Association (ATCQA).Tai chi is considered a mind-body exercise. “I would even add that tai chi is a mind-body-spirit exercise,” says Ruth Taylor-Piliae, PhD, RN, a professor in the behavioral health sciences division at the University of Arizona College of Nursing in Tucson. “The mind reflects a person’s thoughts, emotions, attitudes, and beliefs, while the body is our physical health, and the spirit represents breath. Tai chi can impact all of those aspects of a person,” she says.</p></center>

         <center><H3>MASSAGE</H3></center>
            <center><p>Your body's soft tissues are massaged and kneaded by a massage therapist. Muscle, connective tissue, tendons, ligaments, and skin are examples of soft tissues. The pressure and movement are adjusted by the massage therapist.
A component of integrative medicine is massage. It is often provided along with normal care at medical centers. It is effective for treating a variety of illnesses.
